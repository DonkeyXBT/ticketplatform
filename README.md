## üéØ What We're Building

The ticket reselling business is complex. You're managing:
- Purchases across multiple platforms (Ticketmaster, AXS, SeeTickets...)
- Sales to different buyers on different marketplaces (StubHub, Viagogo...)
- Accounts with 2FA codes you need to access constantly
- Profit calculations across different currencies
- Delivery tracking for multiple buyers per ticket order
- Upcoming events that need delivery reminders

**This platform solves all of that in one place.**
