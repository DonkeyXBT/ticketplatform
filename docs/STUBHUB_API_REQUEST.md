**Subject:** API Partnership Request - Ticket Resale Management Platform

---

Dear StubHub API Team,

I am writing to request API access for our ticket resale management platform. We have developed a comprehensive application specifically designed for professional ticket resellers who manage inventory across multiple marketplaces, including StubHub.

## About Our Application

Our platform is a web-based ticket inventory and profit management system that helps resellers efficiently track and manage their ticket business operations. The application provides:

- **Multi-Platform Inventory Tracking**: Centralized dashboard for tickets purchased from Ticketmaster, AXS, See Tickets, Eventim, and other primary markets
- **Sales Management**: Track listings and sales across secondary marketplaces (StubHub, Viagogo, and others)
- **Financial Analytics**: Real-time profit/loss calculations with multi-currency support (USD, EUR, GBP)
- **Automated Delivery Reminders**: Discord bot integration that sends automated reminders to ensure timely ticket delivery to buyers
- **Event Grouping & Analytics**: Organize tickets by event with detailed revenue and profit breakdowns
- **Data Export**: CSV export functionality for accounting and tax purposes

## Why We Need StubHub API Access

Currently, our users must manually enter StubHub sales data, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. API integration would significantly enhance our platform by enabling:

1. **Automated Listing Management**: Automatically create, update, and delete StubHub listings from our platform
2. **Real-Time Sales Synchronization**: Instant notification when tickets sell on StubHub, eliminating manual data entry
3. **Inventory Accuracy**: Automatic inventory updates to prevent double-selling across platforms
4. **Pricing Optimization**: Dynamic pricing updates based on market conditions
5. **Enhanced Analytics**: Provide users with comprehensive sales performance metrics across all platforms

## Approximate Volume

Our platform is currently in active use with the following anticipated metrics:

- **Active Users**: Starting with 10-50 professional ticket resellers
- **Expected API Calls**:
  - Listing operations: 500-2,000 per day
  - Sales/inventory checks: 1,000-5,000 per day
  - Order management: 200-1,000 per day
- **Projected Growth**: Scaling to 200-500 active resellers within 12 months

Our users are professional, high-volume ticket resellers who actively use StubHub as one of their primary sales channels. By providing them with better tools to manage their StubHub inventory, we believe this partnership would benefit both our platform and StubHub's marketplace activity.

## Technical Implementation

Our application is built with:
- **Backend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **Authentication**: Secure OAuth 2.0 implementation
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel hosting with enterprise-grade security

We are fully prepared to implement all required security protocols, rate limiting, and compliance measures as outlined in StubHub's API documentation.

## Next Steps

We would appreciate the opportunity to discuss:
- API access credentials and authentication requirements
- Integration timeline and technical requirements
- Any compliance or partnership agreements needed
- Sandbox environment access for development and testing

Thank you for considering our request. We are excited about the possibility of integrating StubHub's API to provide our users with a seamless, professional ticket reselling experience.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or documentation about our platform.
