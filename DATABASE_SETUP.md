# üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE SETUP - CRITICAL STEP

## The Problem

Your authentication is failing because **the database tables don't exist yet**. NextAuth needs 4 tables to work:
- `User` - stores user accounts
- `Account` - stores OAuth connections (Discord)
- `Session` - stores authentication sessions
- `VerificationToken` - for NextAuth verification

Without these tables, Discord OAuth completes but the session cannot be saved, causing the redirect loop back to login.

## Solution: Initialize Your Neon Database

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)

Run this single command with your production DATABASE_URL:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:YOUR_PASSWORD@ep-XXX.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require" npm run db:init
```

This will:
1. Generate Prisma Client
2. Create all 5 tables in your Neon database
3. Verify everything was created successfully

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to do it step by step:

```bash
# 1. Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# 2. Push schema to database (creates tables)
DATABASE_URL="your-production-url" npx prisma db push

# 3. Verify tables were created
DATABASE_URL="your-production-url" npm run db:check
```

## Get Your Neon DATABASE_URL

1. Go to [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/)
2. Select your project
3. Click "Connection Details"
4. Copy the connection string (it should look like):
   ```
   postgresql://neondb_owner:PASSWORD@ep-XXX-XXX.region.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```

## After Database Setup

Once the tables are created in Neon, you need to **redeploy to Vercel**:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Your project ‚Üí Deployments

2. **Trigger Redeploy**
   - Click on latest deployment
   - Click "..." menu ‚Üí "Redeploy"
   - Wait for deployment to complete (~2 min)

3. **Test Authentication**
   - Visit https://ticketplatform.vercel.app
   - Click "Sign in with Discord"
   - You should now be redirected to /dashboard ‚úÖ

---

## Verify Everything Works

Run this to check if tables exist:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-production-url" npm run db:check
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ User                  - EXISTS (0 records)
‚úÖ Account               - EXISTS (0 records)
‚úÖ Session               - EXISTS (0 records)
‚úÖ VerificationToken     - EXISTS (0 records)
‚úÖ Ticket                - EXISTS (0 records)
```

---

## What Each Table Does

- **User**: Stores your Discord user info (id, name, email, image)
- **Account**: Links your Discord account to your user (OAuth tokens)
- **Session**: Stores your login session (7-day expiration)
- **VerificationToken**: Used by NextAuth for email verification (not used for Discord)
- **Ticket**: Stores all your ticket purchase/sale data

---

## Troubleshooting

### "DATABASE_URL is not set"
Make sure you're passing the DATABASE_URL before the command:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." npm run db:init
```

### "relation does not exist"
Tables weren't created. Run the init script again.

### "password authentication failed"
Your DATABASE_URL password is incorrect. Get a fresh connection string from Neon.

### "SSL connection error"
Make sure your DATABASE_URL ends with `?sslmode=require`

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This does NOT need to be run in Vercel**

The database setup happens locally on your machine, but it creates the tables in your **production Neon database** (the cloud database that Vercel uses).

‚úÖ **Run this once, use everywhere**

Once the tables are created in Neon, both your local development AND Vercel production will use the same database with the same tables.

---

## Next Steps After Setup

1. ‚úÖ Run database initialization (creates tables)
2. ‚úÖ Verify tables exist with check script
3. ‚úÖ Redeploy to Vercel (uses existing tables)
4. ‚úÖ Test login at https://ticketplatform.vercel.app
5. ‚úÖ Should redirect to dashboard successfully!

The authentication will work once the database has these tables. This was the missing piece! üéØ
